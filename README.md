# Kenya_Conflicts

This project explores the intersection of climatic anomalies, land use, and socio-environmental conflicts (especially pastoralist-farmer conflicts) in Kenya across multiple years.

## Maps and Visualizations

1. Temperature and Precipitation Anomalies (2000â€“2020)

![temp_prec_trend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e812c0aa-02f7-4f0c-a608-400433104e19)

Blue Line: Monthly Temperature Anomaly (Â°C)

Orange Line: Monthly Rainfall Anomaly (mm)

Demonstrates increasing temperature trends and fluctuating rainfall patterns across Kenya.

2. Yearly Precipitation Anomalies by Region
![Precipitation_AnselinCluster2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dc6cbf0-5e3b-4c54-b2d6-309336e3072a)

Composite maps for 2000, 2008, and 2015.

Darker shades indicate more positive precipitation anomalies.

3. Yearly Temperature Anomalies by Region

![Temperture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/519e8ebc-32dc-49e3-921c-2da03af30f24)

Composite maps for 2000, 2008, and 2015.

Darker shades indicate more positive precipitation anomalies.

3. Annual Harvested Area

Highlights the agricultural productivity and food security risks.

Spatial distribution of land area harvested per administrative zone.

4. Land Use and Conflict Distribution

![LandUseLandCover_v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08215de1-07fd-4e10-93d2-88f687910da8)

Detailed land cover classification (Cropland, Natural Vegetation, Grassland, Shrub, etc.)

Red triangles mark conflict events by pastoralists.

Vegetation and water body stats for 2000, 2008, and 2015 included.

5. Spatial Clustering of Conflict Events and Precipitation Deficits
![Precipitation_AnselinCluster2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45971a3e-64b2-4cdc-80fa-597fd1fcf706)

Hotspot analysis using Anselin Local Moranâ€™s I.

Detects high-high, low-low, and outlier clusters of precipitation trends correlated with conflict occurrence.

6. Study Area Map

Regional delineation of Kenya by zones.

Useful for interpreting regional patterns of land use, climate change, and conflict occurrence.
